# FUNCTION
- In js functions are first class object
- function is a datatype, that means we can use it as any other datatype.
- store as variable, pass into another function, return from another function.

# DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING
- cleaner
- avoid control structures like for,while,do while loops, if else(use ternary), switch statements.

# PURE, IMPURE FUNCTIONS
- This function always returns the same output as given the same input parameters. Pure functions only depend on their input parameters and don't affect the state of the application or other parts of the code.
- Functions do not modify any state or have any side effects.
- Functions only depend on their input parameters.
- These are predictable and have a deterministic behavior and are easier to test, debug, and maintain.

-Impure functions are functions that can modify the state of the application or have side effects. In other words, impure functions can have unpredictable behavior and do affect other parts of the application.
- Functions can modify the state of the application or have side effects.
- Functions depend on other parts of the code.
- These are unpredictable and can have a non-deterministic behavior and are harder to test, and maintain.
